      My name is Abtahee Ali and I want to let you in on a secret of mine... my
      go-to hobby! Since I was a about five years old, I loved to dance. At
      first, it was any type of dancing as long as it involved moving my whole
      body. As I got older, I started watching YouTubers, specifically, Brian Puspos, and I fell in love with the hip-hop and free-styling. Any
      chance I had during high school and college, I would put on a song that
      was stuck in my head and start dancing. I learned that dancing was more
      than a hobby for me, it was a way for me to express how I feel through
      movements. Whenever I was in some sort of mood, I would just begin dancing
      in my room or go to a local studio. Nowadays, dancing is an outlet I use
      whenever I am stressed or want to just have fun and jam out! On the flip side, if you are
      interested in knowing the more professional side of me, check out my
